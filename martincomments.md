main comments:

- I highlighted some sections of the theoretical part that still are not clear to understand after the last editing.

- Regarding the response to the reviewers:

  - Reviewers 1 and 2 point to different aspects of the theoretical section. Reviewer 1 is confused, as he thinks the paper deals with redistributive preferences and/or inequality concerns. I thought that this was probably our fault, but Reviewer 2 got it totally clear (as well as reviewer 3). Still, I made polite responses to Reviewer 1.

  - Reviewer 2 is into theory, I agree with this. There were some theoretical explanations in the paper, but we have to recognize that this is an under-researched area and that we are not going to find any big theory (Bourdieu or Luhman kind) explaining this. There are few middle range theories that now are highlighted and presented as such, reviewer 2 was right because the paper was mostly focused on empirical results and now there is more theory and hypothesis, but they are not very different from the original sense that was behind the empirical evidence. Please have a look to the new version and let me know what you think.

  - I think many aspects of Reviewer 3 are covered in the responses to reviewer 2. Still, there is one comment that I do not get: the one about gender and sex: "I was not entirely sure why gender and age played such a prominent role in this paper." ... do they??

  - My major actual concerns is your response to reviewer 1 regarding new variables. What he simply suggests is "I'd recommend sticking with a more conventional set of controls". So, I don't think it is necessary to include meritocracy and other stuff, social class would be enough from my point of view. And there are some risks of including meritocracy: a) this is not a mere "control", we would need a theory to base that, and it would be a different paper, b) now it would really looked similar to Mijs, c) I do not agree at all with Mijs' operationalization of meritocracy, d) this was not mentioned by reviewer 2 or 3 ... and also not by reviewer 1, he just refers to controls.
